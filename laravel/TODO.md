### The architecture needs to be broken down into the relevant tiers (application, database, etcâ€¦).
Done

### The architecture should be completely provisioned via Chef/Puppet/Ansible/similar.
Done

### The deployment of new code and execution of tests should be completely automated. (Bonus points if you are able to catch performance regressions).


### The database and any mutable storage need to be backed up at least daily.
Done

### All relevant logs for all tiers need to be easily accessible (having them on the hosts is not an option).
App - done
DB - ?

### You should fork the repository and use it as the base for your system.
Done

### You should be able to deploy it on one major Cloud provider: AWS / Google Cloud / Azure / DigitalOcean / RackSpace.
Done

### The system should present relevant historical metrics to spot and debug bottlenecks.
Do a dashboard?




### As a solution, please commit to the git repo the following:


### An architectural diagram / PPT to explain your architecture during the interview.


### All the relevant configuration scripts (Chef/Puppet/cfengine/ansible/cloud formation)


### All the relevant runtime handling scripts (start / stop / scale nodes).


### All the relevant backup scripts.


### The forked version of the app you are going to use.
